# advent-of-code-solver
A JavaScript (in the browser, running on [GitHub Pages](https://timichal.github.io/advent-of-code-solver/)) solver for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Focused on readable, functional-ish code over blazing speed and algorithmic shenanigans, but should run fine on your average device. Using fancy modern ECMAScript features and WebAssembly - won't work in your old Internet Explorer.

Solutions my own, except for a few genius-tier parts I couldn't have come up with myself, marked in the comments. I use libraries only when it's clear tomfooolery not to do so - the only ones used so far are [js-combinatorics](https://github.com/dankogai/js-combinatorics) and a [C md5 module](https://github.com/biggun1860/md5-sha1-wasm).

As for code style, I like to adhere to [the Airbnb style guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb). There are a few parts where I ignored it for the sake of readability and/or me liking the code. ESLint screams at me for it, but I learn to live with it.

Feedback welcome!
